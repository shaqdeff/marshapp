# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Marshapp is an AI-powered music generation web platform that enables users to upload songs or instrumentals and generate similar beats using artificial intelligence. The system provides natural language-based refinement capabilities, allowing users to modify generated beats through conversational prompts. The platform is designed as an MVP with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and premium user experience.

## Glossary

- **Marshapp**: The AI music generation web platform system
- **Beat**: An instrumental music track generated by AI models
- **Upload**: A user-submitted audio file (MP3/WAV format)
- **Generation**: The AI process of creating new beats based on uploaded audio
- **Prompt**: Natural language instruction for modifying generated beats
- **Stem**: Individual audio components (drums, bass, melody) separated from a track
- **Waveform**: Visual representation of audio signal amplitude over time
- **Job Queue**: Asynchronous task management system for AI processing
- **Audio Analysis**: Process of extracting tempo, mood, genre, and other metadata from uploads

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to upload audio files to the platform, so that I can generate similar beats using AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an audio file, THE Marshapp SHALL accept MP3 and WAV formats up to 50MB in size
2. WHILE the file is uploading, THE Marshapp SHALL display upload progress with percentage completion
3. IF the uploaded file exceeds size limits or uses unsupported formats, THEN THE Marshapp SHALL display an error message and reject the upload
4. THE Marshapp SHALL store uploaded files securely in cloud storage with unique identifiers
5. WHEN upload completes successfully, THE Marshapp SHALL redirect the user to the generation interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to analyze my uploaded audio, so that AI can generate contextually appropriate beats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio file is uploaded, THE Marshapp SHALL extract tempo, key, and genre metadata within 30 seconds
2. THE Marshapp SHALL perform stem separation to identify drums, bass, and melodic components
3. WHILE analysis is processing, THE Marshapp SHALL display analysis progress to the user
4. THE Marshapp SHALL store extracted metadata in the database linked to the upload record
5. IF analysis fails, THEN THE Marshapp SHALL retry once and notify the user if unsuccessful

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want to generate AI beats similar to my uploaded track, so that I can create new music variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Similar Beat", THE Marshapp SHALL initiate AI beat generation using the analyzed audio
2. THE Marshapp SHALL queue generation jobs and process them asynchronously
3. WHILE generation is processing, THE Marshapp SHALL display estimated completion time and progress updates
4. THE Marshapp SHALL complete beat generation within 5 minutes for standard requests
5. WHEN generation completes, THE Marshapp SHALL store the generated beat and notify the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to refine generated beats using natural language prompts, so that I can customize the output to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a text prompt, THE Marshapp SHALL interpret the instruction and apply corresponding audio modifications
2. THE Marshapp SHALL support prompts for tempo, mood, instrument, and style changes
3. WHILE processing refinement requests, THE Marshapp SHALL maintain the original beat structure
4. THE Marshapp SHALL complete prompt-based modifications within 2 minutes
5. IF a prompt cannot be interpreted, THEN THE Marshapp SHALL request clarification from the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to play, visualize, and download generated beats, so that I can evaluate and use the AI-created music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Marshapp SHALL provide waveform visualization for all generated beats
2. WHEN a user clicks play, THE Marshapp SHALL stream audio with standard playback controls
3. THE Marshapp SHALL allow users to download generated beats in MP3 and WAV formats
4. THE Marshapp SHALL enable social sharing of generated beats through unique URLs
5. WHILE audio is playing, THE Marshapp SHALL highlight the current position on the waveform

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want secure authentication and session management, so that my uploads and generations are protected and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Marshapp SHALL provide user registration and login functionality
2. WHEN a user logs in, THE Marshapp SHALL create a secure session lasting 30 days
3. THE Marshapp SHALL associate all uploads and generations with authenticated user accounts
4. THE Marshapp SHALL allow users to view their generation history and manage their content
5. IF a session expires, THEN THE Marshapp SHALL redirect users to login while preserving their current work

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and monitoring, so that I can maintain platform reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Marshapp SHALL log all system errors with timestamps and user context
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded, THE Marshapp SHALL queue requests and notify users of delays
3. THE Marshapp SHALL monitor system performance and alert administrators of issues
4. THE Marshapp SHALL implement graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
5. THE Marshapp SHALL maintain 99% uptime during normal operating conditions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive performance across devices, so that I can use the platform on desktop and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Marshapp SHALL load the main interface within 3 seconds on standard internet connections
2. THE Marshapp SHALL provide responsive design that adapts to screen sizes from 320px to 1920px width
3. THE Marshapp SHALL support touch interactions for mobile playback controls
4. THE Marshapp SHALL optimize audio streaming for mobile bandwidth constraints
5. THE Marshapp SHALL maintain full functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
